The main focus of this dice game was to create a small project in react to continue practice and maintain proficiency with that library. It also seemed like a fun project and ultimately is a game that can be played for entertainment.

In this project I used:
- React.js
- HTML / JSX
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [react-dice-roll (npm library)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dice-roll)
